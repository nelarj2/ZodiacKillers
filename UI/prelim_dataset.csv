1.0,"When they live or just visit Europe, they want everybody to bend to their customs and way of life. When recently an Iranian minister visited France in an official visit the french arranged for a formal dinner. The Iranian demanded (!) that no wine be served to the table. The French and I love them for this, cancelled the dinner, serving instead an official breakfast! 

What is horrible is that the muslims will kill anyone they think insults their religion, see the massacre of french journalists, even fellow muslims belonging to a different sect. Of course not all moslems are the same and there are countries with a high degree of tolerance like Egypt but these are overshadowed by the fanatics, specially in the countries with a priesthood government."

The US started off with that work done so many people lack the context and awareness. People donÔøΩt realise how a monotheistic Religion in Government can go full medieval for thousands of years. 

Islam has gone through attempts at separation  from Government in some countries but it keeps coming back. Perhaps the fact that the religion is newer and the texts are less ambiguous than the Christian ones makes it harder to separate both. Mohammed was a political figure and a military leader so separation between government and religion is extra difficult. Obviously nothing is set in stone and who knows where humanity will be in a few centuries."
1.0,"All religions are horrible, but yes Islam is quite easily the worst"

1.0,"I don't understand the pass Islam gets in Western countries. It's a reprehensible belief system any way you slice it, just like Christianity. The support hijabis seem to get by mainstream leftist media disgusts me; there is no context in which a hair covering for women in any religion is not misogynistic and we should never celebrate an expression of misogyny even if a woman is choosing to participate in it.

Recently I heard that Turkey is becoming very non-religious. In Europe, religions are fading away. I have no idea, what's happening in USA, its weird :D"
1.0,"Yes. All religion is a threat. Islam more than others. The quran is full of talk about infidels and how to treat them, poorly."
1.0,"They are a threat to themselves right now and the extremist parts of Islam to anyone else. The biggest issue with Islam is it's blatant marriage of church and state. Religion has no place in the governing of nations. Even as an atheist, as stupid as I think it is, if people just quietly did their religion thing and only kept to themselves about it, I couldnt care less if you want to pray in your church or mosque or bedroom. But with the way things are, it's not like that and that is a problem.

The next biggest issue with Islam, and really most religions, is their subhuman treatment of women. You are basically crippling half of your population when who knows the progress we might have as the human race if they worked together instead of beholding middle age barbaric religious rules."
1.0,"Yes . Plenty of concerns 
1) Muslims have higher birth rates and because Islam supports higher birth rates this will be a huge problem in the future .Our planet cannot support that Many humans 
2)Islam won't let women employed .Women empowerment is one of the best way to reduce poverty .
3) Believe in djinns (ghost) is necessary to be Muslim. And unfortunately mental illness such as schizophrenia is considered as jinn possession by Muslims.With the rise of Islam there would be much poorer mental health awareness 
4) Islam opposes science .In modern world there is no place for anti science ideologies 
5) Islam's growth will result in overall poorer rights for women , homosexuals and non Muslims .Death penalty for Blasphemy,apostasy and homosexuality .And legalization of sex slavery,child marriages, domestic violence , polygamy . Eyewitness of woman would be half of man ,share in inheritance would be half and a woman would never be allowed to become judge, imam or caliph 
6)More Terrorism and extremism .A Highly intolerant society would be created"

1.0,"One prophecy, if I remember correctly states that Muslims will one day gather an army of true Muslims, inanimate objects will be on their side, and that they will beat every single enemy they have. Their whole religion revolves around the fact that one day they will prevail and rule the world for a short amount of time before Doomsday. Of course they are a threat. Some smartass with enough guns could convince these morons that that day has come and it's time to kill their enemies."
0.0,"Maybe I'm a contrarian, but I'm somewhat optimistic - religiosity has been declining in the past decade or so across most of the world, including in majority-Muslim countries. While the Iranian government likes to claim that their country is 90%+ Muslim, the reality is that anonymous surveys conducted by outside groups show it's more like 50% and falling - and significantly lower among the (burgeoning) youth population.
(see https://www.dw.com/en/middle-east-are-people-losing-their-religion/a-56442163 for additional insights - the decline is happening in Arab countries also, where as few as 25% of younger generations consider themselves religious)
So while Islam may or may not be actually growing, any growth it might be experiencing is almost all thru population growth - for virtually every segment of the population in most countries, it's shrinking as a percentage of the total. 
To me, it seems that religion spreads in times and places where there is widespread poverty, lack of good public education, and insecurity in general. That probably explains much of the decline over the past decade. Of course, if climate change ends up driving an upswing in poverty and political instability, then religions (including Islam) could pose greater risks."
1.0,"my anecdotal observation is that younger muslims just want to play video games, smoke weed and fool around with their cute friends
 (both male and female)...the existential dynamic of a medieval desert religion seems weird to them and the jihadi nonsense
 repulses them...for which we are all thankful...??"

0.0,"My parents donÔøΩt answer what religion we are on the census since they might one day want to visit Iran and donÔøΩt want to be killed. In Iran, we count as Muslims. My entire extended family are ÔøΩMuslimsÔøΩ on paper and atheists irl.

I have a friend whose parents call him a Muslim on the Canadian census because they are in denial.

This doesnÔøΩt include all the closeted atheists out there.

Muslims are the fastest growing due to birth rates, which are dropping globally. As the quality of life increases, more and more people are leaving religion behind. The estimate of 7% atheists worldwide is definitely a lowball, and it will continue growing.

The Muslims who do remain behind will be those ones who support lgbt, donÔøΩt wear hijab, drink, donÔøΩt fast, etc. kinda like Harry Potter fans, but for the Quran. Harmless."
0.0,"To be honest, not really. Islam is going through a process of secularisation too. It's slow and stealthy, it happens in different places at different rates, 
but it's there. If you look at the data, you will find a rise in Muslims who call themselves non practicing,
 a decrease in mosque attendance, and a lower trust in religious leaders. https://www.arabbarometer.org/2019/12/arabs-are-losing-faith-in-religious-parties-and-leaders/
The more globalisation advances, the quicker this trend will grow
Moments of crisis will revive authoritarian and religious sentiments, it's happening in the west too, but this doesn't change the fact that religion everywhere has entered a phase of decline."
1.0,"Yes
The only thing stopping nuclear war is MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction). Many of these radical muslims literally want the world to end, 'we love death more than the infidel loves life'
The knowledge and intelligence needed to create a nuclear bomb get more and more trivial every single year
I am terrified of the possibility of a radical muslim who has the intelligence and knowledge to create a nuclear bomb, AND think they're going to get the 72 virgins. Because when this combination happens, and it will eventually happen if these trends continue, then that will be the start of nuclear war, to me at least
So called 'moderate' muslims act as a shield for the radical ones. If only radical muslims existed there would be no controversy calling them what they are, but since there are billions of 'peaceful' ones, they shield the others from criticism. Pew polls show that an astonishing amount of 'moderate' muslims want things like sharia law, outlawed homosexuality, death to apostates, and a theocratic islamic state"
0.0,"I see it as a religion that is declining like every other religion. If we look at the Middle East, that region is quickly becoming more and more secularized
. What I do fear however is the response to the fanatics because they are going to be the last people to ever deconvert."
0.0,"Like Christians, most Muslims are the same .  They just want to live, and raised their family  .
  Anyone who is fundamental religions and pushing religious nationalism under fascist regime is dangerous to any society"
1.0,"Yes, Islam specifically. It is objectively even more harmful than the other big players, as evident in the Quran. Muslims can be good people, but they are long overdue for a reformation. Of course, all major religions are generally problematic, and lack of education is the real core issue which religion is interfering with."
0.0,"Every religion is a threat to humanity. It is by the damage that they do and the enemies that they make that they have had their ""authority"" curtailed and eventually fallen in the past. 

Having high population growth won't prevent that from playing out again. It's just, you know, everyone else will suffer for it along side the religious.

Ideally whatever is most politically expedient for the powerful at that point won't be as terrible."
0.0,"You need to understand the data is massively misleading. If someone is born in certain countries they are automatically assumed Muslim.
 When you look at how people actually live in those countries you'd find that many families are not really religious.

I think modernization is going to allow a lot of those families to live as atheists, in the future. I think religious extremism is going to vanish eventually."
0.0,"the answer to your question is no.   I Think the proper question should be posed about religious extremists.

Religious zealots / extremists are the chief threat to humanity and the future, our growth as a species.  There are plenty of people of faith who are reasonable loving people that don't follow whatever stereotype might be perpetuated here. Muslims don't have a monopoly on regressive behavior."
0.0,"A potential threat yes. However, disbelief is probably spreading faster than Islam, so I have hope that cooler heads will prevail in the long term."
0.0,"Not at all a threat. Why? They don't have big strong armies, most of their people are very poor from poor countries besides some rich oil people and they don't have many nukes. All of Humanity? No. 
If I lived in the middle east I'd be very scared. But over here what can they do?

Ocassionally they kill a dozen people with a bomb or a machine gun at a shopping mall or something. Horrific, terrible but in the grand scheme of things not that much. Just a mass murder, which happens every day for non ideological reasons too. Christians invade countries and take armies to fight, muslim terrorists just need cops on their game.

Christian politicians are in charge of most of the worlds most powerful armies. Christians have the money and the power and the nukes, they outpaced Islam a long time ago."
1.0,"Yes, and theres only one reason Islam is growing. And it has to do with the violent nature Islam corrupts all governments, police forces, and armys into further spreading its cause. Convert or die is the only options many people have."
1.0,I truly believe that Islam AND Christianity are the biggest threat . Global peace and prosperity will never be accomplished IÔøΩd people think a being is more power than themselves
1.0,"Islam is the #1 greatest threat to humanity right now. The other religions follow closely behind (maybe not the Rastafarians, those guys are pretty chill)"
1.0,Yes. ItÔøΩs an extremely oppressive religion that would want people like me dead
0.0,"Islam is not a growing religion. Even when Pew posted their research in 2015, it was outdated and there has been a sharp decline in Islam ever since.  


This is more up-to-date, but still is a poor measure of how swift the decline has been. Calling it a steep decline is euphamistic... it is dying and quickly.

https://www.dw.com/en/middle-east-are-people-losing-their-religion/a-56442163"
0.0,"No, Islam is too riven with internal strife. As Muslims spread into developed countries, they will shatter into hundreds of different splinter groups, just as Christianity did. Then those groups will adopt more liberal ideologies in line with popular opinion. ThatÔøΩs just how humans work. No one wants to be part of an oppressive minority for long, especially not in a country where you can be imprisoned for it."
0.0,"Not Islam in particular, but it does sadden me deeply knowing that the world is brimming with science, technology, and possibility, yet the majority/masses are delusional idiots who are quicker to believe in a fantasy story based in zero fact... And somehow, we're all made to respect these idiotic differences.

Imagine being forced respect the delusions and ""perceived offenses"" of the dumbest and religious students in your high school. The same students who say standardized testing isn't fair while they struggle to graduate from an American High School...

If Idiocracy hasn't already taken hold, then I'm the delusional one."
0.0,I think atheism is the fastest growing religion. Islam is not a threat since it has nothing to offer and only flourishes in unproductive countries.
1.0,"People who say Islam is just like other religions, don't know Islam. If Christianity is like Corona, Islam is a like a transfusion of Ebola and common cold. Highly fatal, highly transmissible."
1.0,"Yes, because unlike most other religions it's the most proactively against humanity.... Most religions were born in peaceful if not oppressed state of their founders, Islam was born of conquest."
1.0,I think any religion that forces their beliefs on anyone is a threat to humanity. Christianity and Islam are in the lead.
0.0,Religion is a threat to humanity and the future. It doesnÔøΩt really matter which religion. Islam is no worse and no better than Christianity.
0.0,"All religion is a threat. Actually, only governments who use their religious beliefs to dictate the rule of law. So yeah, the US and plenty of Islamic are pretty much the same in this regard. Some just take it much further than others."
1.0,Yes. And also given that everywhere Islam has touched has gone to crap. So many beautiful societies and civilizations of the world went down once Islam reached it.
0.0,"Why you pulling out 1 religion? Are other religions any more valid? Lots a of posts singling out Muslim, is that strangge or is there some sort of agenda going on here?"
1.0,"Of course it is. All religions are a threat to humanity, and Islam is no exception. However, as Sam Harris points out, the reality is that Islam is currently a bigger threat than the others."
0.0,"Well the terrorists such as taliban are a huge issue because of it's sentiments against women and minorities, idk about the religion in general because i know few nice muslim people."
0.0,"Islam isnÔøΩt growing, a huge number have left the religion and are just too scared to tell others so they still count them as Muslims"
1.0,"Unlike some other religions, which preach peace and coexistence in their latest canon, Islam cannot easily be read as a religion of peace. Several of its core teachings enable tribalism and religious war by any means necessary.

Its existence is a threat to world peace, as has clearly been demonstrated by the literal dozens of sometimes competing extremists groups and the fact that where Islam is prevalent, oppression of women and minorities  almost necessarily follows."
1.0,"I donÔøΩt want to divide the room, but the comments lumping Islam with other religions on this point feels like the equivalent of saying ÔøΩall lives matterÔøΩ. Of all religions currently, Islam is certainly the greatest threat to a humanity and future where liberal principles are valued."
0.0,It's only the fastest growing by birth rate. There's actually a decline in Islam as the newer generations are becoming less and less religious.
0.0,I believe people can believe what they want to- as long as they arenÔøΩt forcing it on others or hurting anyone then itÔøΩs fine.
1.0,"Most of the mainstream religions are a threat but Islam spreads like a deadly, violent, virus. If they wish death upon non believers and atheists then, no I don't have to respect your beliefs
 if it means death to me and mine. I can respect all religions to exist inside your head, your home and your place of worship. Not in the streets, schools and politics."
0.0,"No: Everyone that argues against; has no affinity nor knowledge regarding Islam. Especially the self proclaimed reverts/converts to atheism claiming to have grown up in a ""Muslim"" household.

Why do I say that? Simple bc Islam is very complex and simple at the same time and most judge based on subjectivity and culture.

Islam is not a culture nor just, a religion."
0.0,"Why would it be a threat if only the ones who call themselves Muslims but aren't Muslims commit murders and blow themselves up. 

Real Muslims don't do these things and I think a lot of people just don't know this even though they can see and think for themselves. 

Tell me if any of you have ever been harmed by a Muslim for religious reasons or if you just assume things about people because the media tells you to."
0.0,i dont see it as a threat because they're growing within their own countries. people are free to have children in their own countries
0.0,"According to the statisticd they say Islam will become the most populated religion around 2050. But as i see there are tons of people around here who didn't study Islam properly. Did u hear ""Ottoman Empire"" which build upon ""Islam"" too. And did u hear how did they treat to the ""non-muslims""? I guess you didn't. If you wanna become a real ""Atheist"" so you should have a strong background. Even I can counter your ""scientific explanations"" with my limited knowledge and if you don't believe me, try me. Btw I'm not trying to make u Muslim, I'm just trying to say you should be objective when you judge an ideology but most of you look really subjectice. Haters gonna hate."
0.0,Fucking yes. I am already planning on leaving Europe because of this. You can't say shit against Islam without getting stabbed or getting harassed by woke people who can't bring themselves to criticize Islam in the slightest matter. Fuck this.
0.0,"Lol, no. Have you ever worked with/spoken with them? Literally some of the most charitable people I've met.

Edit what DOES scare me is extremism, and we're seeing so much more here in the west from Christians, THAT is a problem."
0.0,"I think a huge threat to humanity is our evolved capacity for narrative abstraction and projected tribal identity. We classify our comrades as ""other"", tell ourselves frightful stories about them, then make all kinds of horrible decisions as a result. Further, people have used our capacity for reason to conquer most of the limits to our success, leading to rampant over-population. Our capacity for rationalization helps us generate more stories that justify our behaviors, with a distinct bias toward short-term consequences. 

Every year for the rest of your life will be the hottest year on record. So, also, for your children. And your grandchildren, if they can find any water to drink or a shady place to grow crops. Humanity in general is the greatest threat to humanity, why split hairs with any one of our delusions above another?
The future will be just fine, the earth will turn, stars will come and go, time (such as it is) will pass. There probably won't be any people around to worry about it."
0.0,"This is a tough one for me. I used to think erracticating all religions would make the world a better place. It seems itÔøΩs created vacuums for other ideologies to fill itÔøΩs place, like woke extremism for example. IÔøΩd say IÔøΩm more at a place now where IÔøΩm fine with anyone believing in any religion they want. ItÔøΩs not my place to say Chritians good Islam bad cause they all have major issues"

1.0,"You know what gives women more rights than any religion?

No religion."
1.0,"No religion is needed to give women the natural rights and dignity that they deserve.

Whatever prevents them from having this is wrong."
0.0,"Being able to wear a hijab or burka or niqab is a right, if you want to wear them thatÔøΩs fine! ItÔøΩs your right to wear them! Being assaulted/harassed/killed for not wearing them is oppression and really fucked up! ThereÔøΩs a fucking difference!"
0.0,"I mean, thereÔøΩs a discussion to be had about culture vs religion and their huge overlap.  Like genital mutilation has more to do with culture since itÔøΩs practiced by both Christians and Muslim depending on the region.

But Islam gives rights?  Yeah, IÔøΩm skeptical.  IÔøΩd be skeptical of that claim for any religion.  That being said, IÔøΩve seen some people argue that Judaism is pro-choice when it comes to abortions."

1.0,"> ...and it's the culture that was oppresing me all the time.

> Our religion is so beautiful, but it's been used by misogynistic societies we live in as always.

Where religion is a dominant force among people it will be a major element of culture.

If almost every time the religion manages to gain influence over law and governance in a Muslim majority nation it leads to shitty circumstances for women it would suggest the religion either has some fundamental issues, or is fuckin' weak as if it is so easily twisted.

Either way I wouldn't call that beautiful."
1.0,"Lol, your culture is a byproduct of your religion, and your religion is a byproduct of your culture. Both are so intricately and symbiotically related to each other that it is impossible to differentiate them. 

Your culture is predominantly influenced by what Mr. Skyman said. But the words of Mr. Skyman are interpreted by religious leaders who are a product of the social and material conditions around them."
1.0,"Ah yes, as much rights as a donkey. Hope she feels fulfilled for the rest of her life with that."
1.0,The people saying that Islam gives women more rights then any other religion are accidentally just saying every religion takes away a shit load of womenÔøΩs rights.
0.0,"Ah yes, try asking for those ""rights"" and you will get the Mahsa Amini treatment"
1.0,isn't this just shaming your entire culture just to praise your religion? lmao
0.0,Tbh as a muslim myself nobody in my family gives a fuck about islam saying women has no rights really sucks a lot. Like most of the rules that aint the pillars are mostly ignored by muslims in south east asia cuz fuck rules that give no fun
0.0,"No religion is going to ""give"" you more rights than not following religion at all. You have all the freedoms as a non-religious person. Different religions just take different ones away."
1.0,The more i know and learn about islam the more i dislike it. It is vile and disgusting.
1.0,"Sugar, putting that makeup on and recording this video is culture. Islam doesnÔøΩt allow you to look pretty unless your husband demands it and doesnÔøΩt even want you leave the house unless itÔøΩs extremely important so that other people wonÔøΩt see you lmao.

It's the *as practised* part that's the problem."
1.0,If she really thinks that she should take off her hijab in Iran and see how many rights she truly has.
1.0,"All religion does is take away your right to do whatever you want. We don't need religion to tell us not to kill, we already have laws for that.
 But if you want to feel guilt and shame and be shunned by everyone you know for eating a slice of bacon, then yes, religion is for you. Enjoy those extra rights"
1.0,DonÔøΩt they beat women publicly for basically everything? I saw a woman get beat because she was sad her husband cheated on her.

1.0,"I NEVER understood how a Religion could place a manÔøΩs noodle as superior to a womanÔøΩs.

1.0,Showing a lot of face there. Maybe someone should make her wear the full body and face covering to show her even more freedom
1.0,"It's almost as if she's interpreting her religion however she likes. 
Much like the ""oppressors"" are doing!  Seems like you can interpret religious
 texts however you'd like and not really know whether you are more ""right"" than the other person!"
1.0,"Let's say this woman is right, that islam gives the most rights to women.  That's now saying a whole lot.  That's like saying a specific pile of shit is the least stinky, but you have the option of not going near any of the shit in the first place.

There is no point is trying to determine whether she is right or wrong."

0.0,"As a person who has visited many Muslim countries, it's quite interesting to see the differences between the western ways of life and their ways of life. 
There are quite a few restrictions, some social norms that I don't really agree with, and different behaviors that you will definitely notice in Muslim countries.
 However, and I can't stress this enough, people are people regardless of religion or race. I've met some of the most interesting and kindest individuals in the 
countries I've visited. I've also met many who were not so kind. It's important to realize that while there are a lot of differences and some societal or cultural 
traditions/expectations that are downright immoral, a majority of individuals only abide by the rules to not get in trouble. 
There are countless individuals who would definitely disagree with the immoral practices, but because they've been brought up in that lifestyle, 
it's hard to go against it. This doesn't mean that people of these Muslim countries are bad. Some definitely are, but many are not."

Removing puritanical religious laws takes some time to see benefits. Alcohol prohibition in the USA was lifted in 1933.
 It wasn't until the 1960s that we see a liberal cultural revolution in the USA, which is almost certainly the result of the adults in the
 1960s growing up with anti-prohibition parents who were born during or before the prohibition period. It takes a generation to ""forget"" 
the old ways.  That's why society is radically different every 20 years - it's different people reacting to the previous generation's actions.   
In the 90s we had shock jocks like Howard Stern on the radio, shock TV like Jerry Springer or WWF, and weird American-centric cartoons
 like Beavis & Butthead.  Today, we see the echos of that generation in today's generation's actions: they don't like racy TV,
 they don't like politically incorrect humour, their cartoons are imported from Japan, etc.

The same will happen with UAE, assuming this trend continues long enough.   
The next generation will have their racy TV shows, they will have their own style of politically 
incorrect humour, etc.  And, like clockwork, in a generation's time, their culture will once against shift

e3: a bunch of yall are aggressively missing the point. the reason this is important is because this learning belonged to people of color, and it was taken away from them to make them lesser, as another tool to subjugate them to white people. my ancestors stripped these people of everything they had, including their accomplishments in science and mathematics. to not acknowledge this now, to not give credit back to the people to whom it belongs, is to continue to contribute to the ongoing disenfranchisement and reduction of people of color.  i am not responsible for what my ancestors did, but if i perpetuate the lies they started, i am still complicit in it. 

(which reminds me, someone mentioned the Indian Golden Age as another big contributor to knowledge, and i feel like it would be remiss of me not to bring attention to that now.)

e4: i appreciate the awards, but if you're spending money on them, please don't. donate to [Black Lives Matter](https://blacklivesmatter.com/), or to [Stacey Abrams's FairFight](https://fairfight.com/), or to some other worthy cause that supports people of color and other marginalized folks. giving me shinies on Reddit won't change anything. giving that money to people who are fighting for change just might.

e5: christ, the Country Club was the best decision this sub ever made. i don't have to deal with the fucking Islamophobes, their shit gets autodeleted. yall would be sickened if you could see how many of those missing comments are toxic bullshit."

They will constantly paint Islam as the religion of barbarians and as violent savages, just as they do any other religious or ethnic group they come in contact with. However, it is indisputable that Islam was much more accepting of other religions and ideals than Christianity ever was, and arguably more civilized as well. 

The current state of Islam is directly caused by western interference within the Islamic world, with the creation of Israel and the mass destabilization of many nations, extremism and lack of education have become rampant problems plaguing the Islam, but it is important to note that a stable Islamic country was many time more tolerant than a stable Christian country."

Uyghurs are getting tortured/or work in concentration camps in China, Chechen/Dagestans have their own land taken away in Russia, there are ongoing conflicts in the middle east, Africa, etc, they face discrimination in USA, and other developed countries etc.

1.0,"If you look at the world and how people are doing in different geographical locations, you would see that the areas that have contracted Islam are the ones where there is shit ton of poverty, horrible tribal wars, unimaginable atrocities, disregard for human rights, blatant bigotry and gender inequality.

When such issues are talked about, Muslims cry ""Islamophobia!"" or more generally ""Racism!"". You can't critisize Islam without being marked as a white supremacist, new age colonizer, racist and who knows what else Muslims come up with. Though ironically Islam is not a race but an ideology, albeit a horrific one.

Of course all religions share similar problems, such as being incompatible with modern, scientific and fact based understanding of reality, being out of date and incompatible with modern values and also for being blatantly false. But none other has the same morbid characteristics as Islam does. Christianity used to be similar, but Christians tamed their own delusions to make them compatible with the modern world. Muslims have failed to follow suit.

The fact is that Islam has regressed developement in Muslim countries. Maybe Middle-East was the center of scientific research a millennia ago, but who cares about it now? Also as a side note, most of the prominent Islamic golden age scholars, such as Ibn Rushd (Averroes) and Ibn Sina (Avicenna) belonged to the sect of Mutazilla, whose interpretations on Quran are being staunchly rejected by today's Islamic communities. Islamic ""Golden age"" was the result of liberal interpretation of Islam powered by the sect of Mutazilla, before mentally deficient individuals such as Al-Hanbali and Al-Ghazali paved way for Wahhabism.

Muslims have doomed themselves by reversing their own developement as society by following a shitty, iron age book with absurd stories and disgusting morals. They have doomed the future of their children by brainwashing them into believing the same stories they were brainswashed into. Like a virus, Islam has managed to spread and infect a generation after generation. And now it is spreading to Europe, which is very worrysome.

I find it sad that there are only three Muslim Nobel prize winners (in science), and the first one, Pakistani Prof. Dr. Abdus Salam's grave was defaced and the text ""Muslim"" was scraped off from his tombstone, because he was Ahmadi (a small sect of Islam). That is how much Muslims appreciate developement. Abdus Salam should be the pride of Muslims, but instead Muslims reject him because he happened to interpret Quran in a different way.

As a (Middle-Eastern) person who was raised as a Muslim and whose father is an Islamic scholar, I have been exposed to the true face of the said religion. Fortunately I grew up in the West and with an access to information, and thus managed to heal from the mind rot of Islam. Unfortunately not many of the new generation Muslims (especially in Western countries) are capable of doing the same, and the danger of societal isolation and Islamic pockets forming within society are real. Sweden is an excellent example of what happens when you don't take the danger of a iron age ideology seriously.

It really saddens me to see the misery of people who have been oppressed by Islam and its disgusting teachings. Iran for example can be considered as a failed nation, thanks to decades of oppression by their islamic government. Saudi-Arabia is dragging its feet when it comes to human rights, and so does Yemen, Libya, Oman, Jordan, Iraq, Pakistan etc. In Afganistan women are not allowed to even go to school thanks to the religious Talebans. Wherever Islam spreads, misery and sorrow follows.

I am not spreading hate towards Islam. I just want people to be aware of the dangers of it. Also don't get started with ""Western influence"". Westerners realized the dangers of following a medieval ideology and taking it literally, and thus they tamed it down and stopped following its teachings literally. That is why they went ahead while Muslims wallowed in their own Islamic regression. If Muslims had been smart enough to do the same, we might not have so many failed states in Middle-East filled with death and destruction."

0.0,"Why do Muslim Apologists accuse critics of Islam of Islamophobia?

Because it is an effective way of changing the main topic from ""the bad aspects of Islam"" to ""how questionably the morals of the critics are"".

The simplest approach is to ignore the accusation and re-iterate the criticisms. Islam has bad points and they deserve addressing. You are well in your rights to ask about punishment for apostasy, inequality, child-marriage etc.. Asking critical questions about bad aspects or pointing out flaws is not the same as calling out to hate all Muslims, which you are not.

If you want you can also point out that they are trying to block all criticism of Islam, and that you'd rather stick to points you are trying to make.

In the end: We condemn hate crimes against Muslims, like the man who killed several family-members who were just out for a walk, with a car in Canada. People are free to believe religions. But we are free to criticize the religions and explain why we think people should not join them, or existing members should consider leaving. It is just reverse dawah. btw. we also condemn (like most Muslims condemn), hate crimes between sects, like the bombing of Shia school-children by Sunni-extremists which killed 80 female students in Kabul about a year ago.

Also, some Muslims say they dont do skincare routines because the wudhi, so how are they wearing spf? Sooo thats that for ya.

so im agnostic, i was raised roman catholic doing the church thing till 12 when i made my own choices. my sister goes to community group for church every thursday, im 31 now and shes older then me. i think shes well aware of my personal opinions but i dont share them and she doesnt tell me off when i drop a god damn it or a jesus fucking christ in front of her. we coexist in this world peacefully and with out interference. we both love each other like family should.

why should i question a personal belief that doesnt effect me and makes her happy?

so we generally talk about christian extremism, cause it effects people or muslim extreamism. but id say a far more extreme form of christianity is the amish. a group of people you may have forgotten about. or hasidic jews. another group thats pretty fucking hard core about following the book. but i dont hear shit about them. why? cause they keep to them selves. the issue isnt being extreme in your religious beleifs. its telling others they need to listen to your beliefs.

lastly, idk how to really word this but although i dont have a belief in a higher power i dont think i should be the one to question another persons personal relationship with a higher power. that should be personal and remain between you and what ever you believe in. and as long as you dont tell me about it or tell my friends and family or really anyone besides people who want to hear about it, why the fuck do i care?"

Edit: ffs the things people are assuming I mean. I'm just saying be respectful, don't wish harm on others.

I don't think bigotry of any kind deserves respect but equally religious people/those of any faith don't necessarily agree entirely with holy books /religious systems.

Also just because other people have been bad to you doesn't excuse violence in kind. This is why wars don't end because 'the other side did so and so which means we're justified in doing the same'. Bad behaviour doesn't have to be the worst /worse than something before it to be condemned. Can't we try to be respectful of individuals and their faith /lack of faith WHILE STILL working against oppression, tyranny and bigotry?

But also very devout women treat other women who don't wear hijab as some sort of sluts according to how they talk about them, which doesn't help at all if you are girl growing up in this kind of household, who doesn't want to wear it, because you start building the association of ""slut = not wearing Hijab"".

And from what I have seen and I bet women seen it too that from those countries a lot of sexual harassment would get dismissed if a women wasn't wearing hijab as if she was ""asking for it"" by not wearing it.

For a women to take off her Hijab, she might risk getting shunned by her family even by her own mother, and also accused of being ""loose"" and getting harassed in her community, so how do you even call this a choice?

They take it as an attack to their values and culture when you criticize Islam. But they also say ‚Äúit‚Äôs culture not religion‚Äù when you criticize it as a ‚Äúculture‚Äù because Islam is ‚Äúone true peaceful religion‚Äù.

If it‚Äôs a belief system it‚Äôs not ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù or ‚Äútrue‚Äù. If it‚Äôs a race thing muslims are bunch of fascists. But nope, they don‚Äôt accept neither.

1.0,"I feel like an irrational fear of an irrational belief system is perfectly fine too. Once we start talking about a religion who‚Äôs prophet is a dude who rode a horse into the clouds and who married a 6 year old, any criticism or fear kind of by default is rational."
1.0,"Plus they hate dogs so much that not only are people banned from owning one for companionship, Islam (Muhammed hadiths?) also states something like 'a dog looking at you during prayer nulifies the prayer'

All religions are fucked up, but if your religion bans dogs as pets, it's the worst religion."

1.0,"There are a lot of Muslim families in my apartment building and that explains why when I‚Äôm in the elevator with my dog they act like I have a full grown bear on a leash. Yesterday I was already on the elevator, the door opened to a woman and she literally shrieked when she saw him and frightfully said she‚Äôll wait for the next one. Most of the families are cool about it but there are definitely a few individuals that it‚Äôs like I pulled a gun on them. And he‚Äôs just a small happy looking dog that sits down right next to my leg on the elevator. And there are many dogs in our building. It must be exhausting for those few individuals to ride the elevator."
1.0,"so burning it makes zero sense to me

Seems like she's being deliberately imperceptive.

Sure, you can say the real issue isn't the piece of cloth, it's the oppressive systems that force women to wear them, or face punishment.

The reason then they are burning them is as gesture of defiance against those oppresive systems.

What would she rather instead? That they start burning down the system itself... actually now that I say that it is actually what's needed: straight to the pyre with religious laws."
1.0,"Islam does worry me, and it should make others worry too. If more people read the Quran, they would know this. Labeling criticism of a choice of religion the same as something like ""homophobia"" or ""xenophobia"" is what people should really be offended by.

Many societies have a real problem right now with moral relativism and some conflating religion with a person's ethnicity. You shouldn't be able to run away from a debate about bad, immoral ideas by calling everyone racist. You are pointing to racist idiots and then labeling everyone who disagrees with your IDEAS as the same as those idiots, which is a very obvious fallacy that many people can't even recognize anymore.

Bad ideas never deserve protection."
1.0,"Stop it with the ____phobic bullshit. The term ‚Äúphobia‚Äù is literally changing because of it.

If I burnt a hijab in protest of a Muslim girl being killed, it‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm terrified of them. It‚Äôs because Islam is the worst religion out there and treats their women like slaves/property."
1.0,"Islam wants me oppressed or dead, so why shouldn't I have a phobia of it?

"
0.0,"As someone who has quite a few Muslim friends (both who wear and don't wear a hijab), I can understand the curiosity of wanting to see what they look like without the headscarf. But it feels a bit odd wanting to force them to take it off just to satiate that curiosity and lowkey sexualize it. Whether a woman chooses to wear or not wear a hijab, both are valid and both fights are valid."
0.0,"Omg the guy from Pakistan made me smile so big when he said that Islam is a religion of peace. I am Muslim and everywhere I look I see people discriminating Islam in some way. So I really appreciated that. Also when he and the girl from India said they could be friends, that really warmed my heart. Because even though there is war in their countries they could still talk it out.

0.0,"I honestly love this video, it definitely shows that you do not judge a book by its cover. There is a massive cultural stigma on muslims and it really goes to show how uneducated we are on other people‚Äôs religions.

0.0,Islam is the most peaceful religion in the world.
1.0,"If that's the case then it just means the people you met suffered from only mild Islamic mental illness.

Islam is one of the biggest problems on this planet and it will get worse unless we treat this mental illness.

Good news is that it can in fact be treated, just like OCD can. Our fellow muslim friends have been overtaken by Islam and they need our help to escape it so they can get better."
0.0,It's interesting to see how each muslim look at Islam from their own perspective and this is why Islam is a diverse religion not because it connects all humans together but also because it connects different cultures and believes. I somehow found myself agreeing with them all in different points
0.0,wow this is the first jubilee episode I've ever watched where the people are all nice and very sweet towards each other. they even apologized and said 'i love you' when they eliminated someone. it's sad how people still think Muslims are a bunch of terrorists just because of what they heard through the media
