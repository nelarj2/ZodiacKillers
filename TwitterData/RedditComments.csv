While the Iranian government likes to claim that their country is 90%+ Muslim, the reality is that anonymous surveys conducted by outside groups show it's more like 50% and falling - and significantly lower among the (burgeoning) youth population.
(see https://www.dw.com/en/middle-east-are-people-losing-their-religion/a-56442163 for additional insights - the decline is happening in Arab countries also, where as few as 25% of younger generations consider themselves religious)
So while Islam may or may not be actually growing, any growth it might be experiencing is almost all thru population growth - for virtually every segment of the population in most countries, it's shrinking as a percentage of the total. 
To me, it seems that religion spreads in times and places where there is widespread poverty, lack of good public education, and insecurity in general.

e: a bunch of people keep trying to comment about how the Golden Age of Islam wasn't a real thing, or saying something fucked Islam up along the way, or asking why we're still praising them for it. fortunately, they're not in the Club, so their comments get auto deleted. all i have to add is: bigots mad ø/

e2: one of said assholes left a link to the Wikipedia article on Operation Paperclip, where hundreds of Nazi scientists, including Wernher von Braun, were smuggled out of Nazi Germany and into the US to work in STEM fields for the US government. this person was attempting to say that Muslims are equivalent to Nazis while being too much of a coward to actually come out and say it. fuck you in particular, sir.

e3: a bunch of yall are aggressively missing the point. the reason this is important is because this learning belonged to people of color, and it was taken away from them to make them lesser, as another tool to subjugate them to white people. my ancestors stripped these people of everything they had, including their accomplishments in science and mathematics. to not acknowledge this now, to not give credit back to the people to whom it belongs, is to continue to contribute to the ongoing disenfranchisement and reduction of people of color.  i am not responsible for what my ancestors did, but if i perpetuate the lies they started, i am still complicit in it. 

(which reminds me, someone mentioned the Indian Golden Age as another big contributor to knowledge, and i feel like it would be remiss of me not to bring attention to that now.)

When such issues are talked about, Muslims cry ""Islamophobia!"" or more generally ""Racism!"". You can't critisize Islam without being marked as a white supremacist, new age colonizer, racist and who knows what else Muslims come up with. Though ironically Islam is not a race but an ideology, albeit a horrific one.

Of course all religions share similar problems, such as being incompatible with modern, scientific and fact based understanding of reality, being out of date and incompatible with modern values and also for being blatantly false. But none other has the same morbid characteristics as Islam does. Christianity used to be similar, but Christians tamed their own delusions to make them compatible with the modern world. Muslims have failed to follow suit.

The fact is that Islam has regressed developement in Muslim countries. Maybe Middle-East was the center of scientific research a millennia ago, but who cares about it now? Also as a side note, most of the prominent Islamic golden age scholars, such as Ibn Rushd (Averroes) and Ibn Sina (Avicenna) belonged to the sect of Mutazilla, whose interpretations on Quran are being staunchly rejected by today's Islamic communities. Islamic ""Golden age"" was the result of liberal interpretation of Islam powered by the sect of Mutazilla, before mentally deficient individuals such as Al-Hanbali and Al-Ghazali paved way for Wahhabism.

Muslims have doomed themselves by reversing their own developement as society by following a shitty, iron age book with absurd stories and disgusting morals. They have doomed the future of their children by brainwashing them into believing the same stories they were brainswashed into. Like a virus, Islam has managed to spread and infect a generation after generation. And now it is spreading to Europe, which is very worrysome.

I find it sad that there are only three Muslim Nobel prize winners (in science), and the first one, Pakistani Prof. Dr. Abdus Salam's grave was defaced and the text ""Muslim"" was scraped off from his tombstone, because he was Ahmadi (a small sect of Islam). That is how much Muslims appreciate developement. Abdus Salam should be the pride of Muslims, but instead Muslims reject him because he happened to interpret Quran in a different way.

As a (Middle-Eastern) person who was raised as a Muslim and whose father is an Islamic scholar, I have been exposed to the true face of the said religion. Fortunately I grew up in the West and with an access to information, and thus managed to heal from the mind rot of Islam. Unfortunately not many of the new generation Muslims (especially in Western countries) are capable of doing the same, and the danger of societal isolation and Islamic pockets forming within society are real. Sweden is an excellent example of what happens when you don't take the danger of a iron age ideology seriously.

It really saddens me to see the misery of people who have been oppressed by Islam and its disgusting teachings. Iran for example can be considered as a failed nation, thanks to decades of oppression by their islamic government. Saudi-Arabia is dragging its feet when it comes to human rights, and so does Yemen, Libya, Oman, Jordan, Iraq, Pakistan etc. In Afganistan women are not allowed to even go to school thanks to the religious Talebans. Wherever Islam spreads, misery and sorrow follows.

I am not spreading hate towards Islam. I just want people to be aware of the dangers of it. Also don't get started with ""Western influence"". Westerners realized the dangers of following a medieval ideology and taking it literally, and thus they tamed it down and stopped following its teachings literally. That is why they went ahead while Muslims wallowed in their own Islamic regression.

Because it is an effective way of changing the main topic from ""the bad aspects of Islam"" to ""how questionably the morals of the critics are"".

The simplest approach is to ignore the accusation and re-iterate the criticisms. Islam has bad points and they deserve addressing. You are well in your rights to ask about punishment for apostasy, inequality, child-marriage etc.. Asking critical questions about bad aspects or pointing out flaws is not the same as calling out to hate all Muslims, which you are not.

If you want you can also point out that they are trying to block all criticism of Islam, and that you'd rather stick to points you are trying to make.

In the end: We condemn hate crimes against Muslims, like the man who killed several family-members who were just out for a walk, with a car in Canada. People are free to believe religions. But we are free to criticize the religions and explain why we think people should not join them, or existing members should consider leaving.
