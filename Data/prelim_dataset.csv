Islam has gone through attempts at separation  from Government in some countries but it keeps coming back. Perhaps the fact that the religion is newer and the texts are less ambiguous than the Christian ones makes it harder to separate both.

4) Islam opposes science .In modern world there is no place for anti science ideologies 
5) Islam's growth will result in overall poorer rights for women , homosexuals and non Muslims .Death penalty for Blasphemy,apostasy and homosexuality .And legalization of sex slavery,child marriages, domestic violence , polygamy .

0.0,"Maybe I'm a contrarian, but I'm somewhat optimistic - religiosity has been declining in the past decade or so across most of the world, including in majority-Muslim countries. While the Iranian government likes to claim that their country is 90%+ Muslim, the reality is that anonymous surveys conducted by outside groups show it's more like 50% and falling - and significantly lower among the (burgeoning) youth population.
(see https://www.dw.com/en/middle-east-are-people-losing-their-religion/a-56442163 for additional insights - the decline is happening in Arab countries also, where as few as 25% of younger generations consider themselves religious)
So while Islam may or may not be actually growing, any growth it might be experiencing is almost all thru population growth - for virtually every segment of the population in most countries, it's shrinking as a percentage of the total. 
To me, it seems that religion spreads in times and places where there is widespread poverty, lack of good public education, and insecurity in general. That probably explains much of the decline over the past decade. Of course, if climate change ends up driving an upswing in poverty and political instability, then religions (including Islam) could pose greater risks.",Reddit

This doesn�t include all the closeted atheists out there.

Muslims are the fastest growing due to birth rates, which are dropping globally. As the quality of life increases, more and more people are leaving religion behind. The estimate of 7% atheists worldwide is definitely a lowball, and it will continue growing.

The Muslims who do remain behind will be those ones who support lgbt, don�t wear hijab, drink, don�t fast, etc. kinda like Harry Potter fans, but for the Quran. Harmless.",Reddit
0.0,"To be honest, not really. Islam is going through a process of secularisation too. It's slow and stealthy, it happens in different places at different rates,

 a decrease in mosque attendance, and a lower trust in religious leaders. https://www.arabbarometer.org/2019/12/arabs-are-losing-faith-in-religious-parties-and-leaders/

The only thing stopping nuclear war is MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction). Many of these radical muslims literally want the world to end, 'we love death more than the infidel loves life'
The knowledge and intelligence needed to create a nuclear bomb get more and more trivial every single year
I am terrified of the possibility of a radical muslim who has the intelligence and knowledge to create a nuclear bomb, AND think they're going to get the 72 virgins. Because when this combination happens, and it will eventually happen if these trends continue, then that will be the start of nuclear war, to me at least

Of course all religions share similar problems, such as being incompatible with modern, scientific and fact based understanding of reality, being out of date and incompatible with modern values and also for being blatantly false. But none other has the same morbid characteristics as Islam does. Christianity used to be similar, but Christians tamed their own delusions to make them compatible with the modern world. Muslims have failed to follow suit.

The fact is that Islam has regressed developement in Muslim countries. Maybe Middle-East was the center of scientific research a millennia ago, but who cares about it now? Also as a side note, most of the prominent Islamic golden age scholars, such as Ibn Rushd (Averroes) and Ibn Sina (Avicenna) belonged to the sect of Mutazilla, whose interpretations on Quran are being staunchly rejected by today's Islamic communities. Islamic ""Golden age"" was the result of liberal interpretation of Islam powered by the sect of Mutazilla, before mentally deficient individuals such as Al-Hanbali and Al-Ghazali paved way for Wahhabism.

Muslims have doomed themselves by reversing their own developement as society by following a shitty, iron age book with absurd stories and disgusting morals. They have doomed the future of their children by brainwashing them into believing the same stories they were brainswashed into. Like a virus, Islam has managed to spread and infect a generation after generation. And now it is spreading to Europe, which is very worrysome.

I find it sad that there are only three Muslim Nobel prize winners (in science), and the first one, Pakistani Prof. Dr. Abdus Salam's grave was defaced and the text ""Muslim"" was scraped off from his tombstone, because he was Ahmadi (a small sect of Islam). That is how much Muslims appreciate developement. Abdus Salam should be the pride of Muslims, but instead Muslims reject him because he happened to interpret Quran in a different way.

As a (Middle-Eastern) person who was raised as a Muslim and whose father is an Islamic scholar, I have been exposed to the true face of the said religion. Fortunately I grew up in the West and with an access to information, and thus managed to heal from the mind rot of Islam. Unfortunately not many of the new generation Muslims (especially in Western countries) are capable of doing the same, and the danger of societal isolation and Islamic pockets forming within society are real. Sweden is an excellent example of what happens when you don't take the danger of a iron age ideology seriously.

It really saddens me to see the misery of people who have been oppressed by Islam and its disgusting teachings. Iran for example can be considered as a failed nation, thanks to decades of oppression by their islamic government. Saudi-Arabia is dragging its feet when it comes to human rights, and so does Yemen, Libya, Oman, Jordan, Iraq, Pakistan etc. In Afganistan women are not allowed to even go to school thanks to the religious Talebans. Wherever Islam spreads, misery and sorrow follows.

I am not spreading hate towards Islam. I just want people to be aware of the dangers of it. Also don't get started with ""Western influence"". Westerners realized the dangers of following a medieval ideology and taking it literally, and thus they tamed it down and stopped following its teachings literally. That is why they went ahead while Muslims wallowed in their own Islamic regression. If Muslims had been smart enough to do the same, we might not have so many failed states in Middle-East filled with death and destruction.",Reddit

0.0,"Why do Muslim Apologists accuse critics of Islam of Islamophobia?

Because it is an effective way of changing the main topic from ""the bad aspects of Islam"" to ""how questionably the morals of the critics are"".

The simplest approach is to ignore the accusation and re-iterate the criticisms. Islam has bad points and they deserve addressing. You are well in your rights to ask about punishment for apostasy, inequality, child-marriage etc.. Asking critical questions about bad aspects or pointing out flaws is not the same as calling out to hate all Muslims, which you are not.

If you want you can also point out that they are trying to block all criticism of Islam, and that you'd rather stick to points you are trying to make.

In the end: We condemn hate crimes against Muslims, like the man who killed several family-members who were just out for a walk, with a car in Canada. People are free to believe religions. But we are free to criticize the religions and explain why we think people should not join them, or existing members should consider leaving.

Many societies have a real problem right now with moral relativism and some conflating religion with a person's ethnicity. You shouldn't be able to run away from a debate about bad, immoral ideas by calling everyone racist. You are pointing to racist idiots and then labeling everyone who disagrees with your IDEAS as the same as those idiots, which is a very obvious fallacy that many people can't even recognize anymore.

Bad ideas never deserve protection.",Reddit

But it feels a bit odd wanting to force them to take it off just to satiate that curiosity and lowkey sexualize it. Whether a woman chooses to wear or not wear a hijab, both are valid and both fights are valid.",Youtube
0.0,"Omg the guy from Pakistan made me smile so big when he said that Islam is a religion of peace. I am Muslim and everywhere I look I see people discriminating Islam in some way. So I really appreciated that. Also when he and the girl from India said they could be friends, that really warmed my heart. Because even though there is war in their countries they could still talk it out.

Islam is one of the biggest problems on this planet and it will get worse unless we treat this mental illness.

Good news is that it can in fact be treated, just like OCD can. Our fellow muslim friends have been overtaken by Islam and they need our help to escape it so they can get better.",Youtube
